### PLSC 508 Networks Tutorial (9/24/24)
This tutorial provides a guide to popularity, or preferential attachment, in networks. Preferential attachment means that the more connected a node is, the more likely it is to receive new links. Nodes with higher degrees have a stronger ability to attract links added to the network.

1. `MD_Tutorial.Rmd` is the main script with the tutorial and analysis of preferential attachment in simulated and replicated networks.
2. `drugnet.csv` is the main dataset used for the tutorial from the author's replication data.
3. `MD_Tutorial.pdf` is a pdf rendering of the tutorial without any code. 
4. The data used in the main analysis is from Colby, Darren. “Chaos from Order: A Network Analysis of In-Fighting Before and After El Chapo's Arrest.” Connections 41, no. 1 (2021): 1–11. [https://doi.org/10.21307/connections-2021.023](https://doi.org/10.21307/connections-2021.023).
